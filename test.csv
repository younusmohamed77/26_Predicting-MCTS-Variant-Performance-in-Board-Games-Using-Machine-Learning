(As in 'Y') First turn is a single move. In the standard game subsequent turns have two placements each. The player seeking to connect with the darker color starts. The moves consist of two parts: placement, then conditional 'flipping' of stones: - Placement is to any empty location. - 'Flipping' means changing the color of a stone that has more neighbors of its own color than enemy neighbors. Flipping is restricted to the selected option. Stones are flipped one at a time until no more can flip. Options are: -- 00'Y': All - Each applicable stone flips, one at a time with cascading effects, until no more can flip. -- Defector Y: Enemies flip into Friends - these might be pieces near/at the stone just placed, and/or a stone the opponent flipped. -- Friends flip into Enemies - these might be pieces near/at the opponent's last placements or flips. The first player to connect all 3 sides after the all flips have been made is the winner.","(game ""00'Y'"" (players 2) (equipment { (board (tri Limping 4) use:Vertex) (piece ""Disc"" Each) (piece ""Counter"" Neutral maxState:2) } ) (rules (play (priority { (if (is Prev Mover) (or (move Add (piece (id ""Disc"" Mover)) (to (sites Occupied by:Next) if:(< (count Pieces Mover in:(sites Around (to) Orthogonal) ) (count Pieces Next in:(sites Around (to) Orthogonal) ) ) (apply (remove (to))) ) ) (move Add (piece (id ""Disc"" Next)) (to (sites Occupied by:Mover) if:(< (count Pieces Next in:(sites Around (to) Orthogonal) ) (count Pieces Mover in:(sites Around (to) Orthogonal) ) ) (apply (remove (to))) ) ) ) ) (move Add (to (sites Empty)) (then (set Var ""MoveInTurn"" (% (+ 3 (var ""MoveInTurn"")) 2) ) ) ) } (then (if (or (= 1 (var ""MoveInTurn"")) (can Move (or (move Add (piece (id ""Disc"" Mover)) (to (sites Occupied by:Next) if:(< (count Pieces Mover in:(sites Around (to) Orthogonal ) ) (count Pieces Next in:(sites Around (to) Orthogonal ) ) ) (apply (remove (to))) ) ) (move Add (piece (id ""Disc"" Next)) (to (sites Occupied by:Mover) if:(< (count Pieces Next in:(sites Around (to) Orthogonal ) ) (count Pieces Mover in:(sites Around (to) Orthogonal ) ) ) (apply (remove (to))) ) ) ) ) ) (moveAgain) (if (< 0 (size Array (array (forEach (sites Occupied by:Next) if:(is Connected 3 at:(site) { (union (sites Side NE) (sites Side N) ) (union (sites Side SE) (sites Side S) ) (union (sites Side NW) (sites Side SW) ) } ) ) ) ) ) (trigger ""Win"" Next) ) ) ) ) ) (end { (if (is Triggered ""Win"" Next) (result Next Win)) (if (and (no Moves Mover) (< 0 (size Array (array (forEach (sites Occupied by:Next) if:(is Connected 3 at:(site) { (union (sites Side NE) (sites Side N) ) (union (sites Side SE) (sites Side S) ) (union (sites Side NW) (sites Side SW) ) } ) ) ) ) ) ) (result Next Win) ) } ) ) )"
